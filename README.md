# Google Weather Card

Modification of the original <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starlender/art/Weather-Card-Rainmeter-Skin-GoogleAssistantStyle-789320003" target="_blank">Google Weather Card</a> to work with WeatherBit, ~~Dark Sky~~ and OpenWeatherMap

## WeatherBit Skin
### To use
After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin by right clicking and click on Edit Weather Variables.

For the location you have the choice of the following:

* Latitude/Longitude (Default)
* City Name
* Postal code
* City id

You can see how to change the API call by looking at the <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

Once the variables are set simply refresh the skin and it will start working automatically.

The weather icons are courtesy of Erik Buick. I do have the purple night icons so I can add if people want them over the new blue night icons.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data. Please direct your complaints to** <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">**WeatherBit**</a>, ~~<a href="https://darksky.net/" target="_blank">**Dark Sky**</a>~~ or <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">**OpenWeatherMap**</a> **if you have any issues.**
