This branch contains a basic skin setup that you can modify for your own API source and the others can be found in their own branch and you can check the releases section for the skin download for the provider that you choose.

The WeatherIcons folder contains the most popular weather icons and if you would like to download the whole set you can find them <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTLy6Rb-JADRS9ynwk3z9WsYawEGUjA1/view" target="_blank">here</a>

## Dark Sky API
On March 31st Dark Sky announced move to Apple and the shutdown of their API. If you have an existing key it will still work until 2023 and I will leave the skin up for download until the API shuts down.

**If you are not a Dark Sky subscriber (any tier) do not download the Dark Sky skin as signups are disabled**

## To use
After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin.

Once the variables are set simply refresh the skin and it will start working automatically.

The weather icons are courtesy of Erik Buick.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data.**
