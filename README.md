# Google Weather Card

Modification of the original <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starlender/art/Weather-Card-Rainmeter-Skin-GoogleAssistantStyle-789320003" target="_blank">Google Weather Card</a> to work with WeatherBit, ~~Dark Sky~~ and OpenWeatherMap

## Dark Sky API
On March 31st Dark Sky announced move to Apple and the shutdown of their API. If you have an existing key it will still work until 2021 and I will leave the skin up for download until the API shuts down.

**If you are not a Dark Sky subscriber (any tier) do not download the skin as signups are disabled**

## To use
After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin.

Once the variables are set simply refresh the skin and it will start working automatically.

If using anything other than lat/lon edit the API calls to match what you are using.

The weather icons are courtesy of Erik Buick. I do have the purple night icons so I can add if people want them over the new blue night icons.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data. Please direct your complaints to** <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">**WeatherBit**</a>, ~~<a href="https://darksky.net/" target="_blank">**Dark Sky**</a>~~ or <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">**OpenWeatherMap**</a> **if you have any issues.**
