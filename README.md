# Google Weather Card

Modification of the original <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starlender/art/Weather-Card-Rainmeter-Skin-GoogleAssistantStyle-789320003" target="_blank">Google Weather Card</a> to work with WeatherBit and Dark Sky

## To use
After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables.<br />**Only 1 of the following needs to be filled out for location data** (For WeatherBit)
* Latitude & Longitude
* City,State (Optional),Country(Optional)
* Postal Code
* City ID

If using anything other than lat/lon edit the API calls to match what you are using.

The weather icons are courtesy of Erik Buick. I do have the purple night icons so I can add if people want them over the new blue night icons.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data. Please direct your complaints to** <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">**WeatherBit**</a> or <a href="https://darksky.net/" target="_blank">**Dark Sky**</a> **if you have any issues.**
