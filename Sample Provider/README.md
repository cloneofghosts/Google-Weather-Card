# Google Weather Card

Modification of the original <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starlender/art/Weather-Card-Rainmeter-Skin-GoogleAssistantStyle-789320003" target="_blank">Google Weather Card</a> to work with ~~<a href="https://weatherbit.io/" target="_blank">WeatherBit</a>~~, ~~<a href="https://darksky.net/" target="_blank">Dark Sky</a>~~, <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> and <a href="https://metoffice.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/metoffice/production/" target="_blank">Met Office</a>

This branch contains a basic skin setup that you can modify for your own API source and you can check the releases section for the skin download for the provider that you choose.

The WeatherIcons folder contains the most popular weather icons and if you would like to download the whole set you can find them <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTLy6Rb-JADRS9ynwk3z9WsYawEGUjA1/view" target="_blank">here</a>

## To use
Copy the Sample Provider Folder into your Rainmeter skins folder and edit a skin in your program of choice. Look up the documentation of the provider of your choice and make the edits where necessary. Once the skin is functional you can copy the current skins to the other existing skins (be sure to change the background and where needed the text colour)

The weather icons are courtesy of Erik Buick.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data.**
