## Met Office Skin
### To use
After installing edit the Variables in /@Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin or right click on skin and click on Edit Weather Variables.

Once the variables are set simply refresh the skin and it will start working automatically.

### Change the Language

* Met Office does not contain weather descriptions so a custom mapping was made for each of their significant weather codes.
- You can right click on the skin and click on Edit Weather Language to edit the current weather or browse to /@Resources/Language
* To translate create a copy of the file and edit the text into your local language. The recommended naming convention is language_name.inc and edit the variables section to match the new language name.
  * Feel free to make a pull request with any additional languages.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data.**
