## WeatherBit Skin
### To use
After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin by right clicking and click on Edit Weather Variables.

For the location you have the choice of the following:

* Latitude/Longitude (Default)
* City Name
* Postal code
* City id

You can see how to change the API call by looking at the <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

### Change the Language

* You can right click on the skin and click on Edit Weather Language to edit the current weather or browse to /@Resources/Language

* To translate create a copy of the file and edit the text into your local language. The recommended naming convention is language_name.inc and edit the variables section to match the new language name.
* Feel free to make a pull request with any additional languages.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data.**
