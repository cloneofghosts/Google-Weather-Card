## **Dark Sky API**
On March 31st Dark Sky announced move to Apple and the shutdown of their API. If you have an existing key it will still work until 2021 and I will leave the skin up for download until the API shuts down.

**If you are not a Dark Sky subscriber (any tier) do not download the as signups are disabled**

## Dark Sky Skin
### To use

After installing edit the Variables in Resources/Variables with the values you wish to use with the skin.

Once the variables are set simply refresh the skin and it will start working automatically.

**Please don't complain about the API being inaccurate as I don't have any control over the data.**
